# Jack's Emacs config

My [old Emacs config](https://code.google.com/p/letouj-emacs-cfg/) was starting to get crufty and unwieldy, so I declared [.emacs bankruptcy](http://emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/) and am starting over with a fresh config and an overdue upgrade to Emacs 24.
